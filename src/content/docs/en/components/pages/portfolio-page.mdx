# Portfolio Page

New in **AstroGlass**, the Portfolio Page is a dedicated, dynamic route that provides a rich showcase for your projects. It features category filtering, detailed project views, and a design that adapts to your active theme.

## Architecture

The portfolio page is served at `/[theme]/portfolio` (e.g., `/liquid/portfolio`, `/glass/portfolio`). It uses a dynamic routing strategy similar to the main theme pages.

### File Structure

- **Route**: `src/pages/[theme]/portfolio.astro` - The dynamic route handler.
- **Components**: `src/components/pages/portfolio/{theme}/` - Theme-specific modular section implementations (e.g., `PortfolioHeroLiquid.astro`, `PortfolioGridLiquid.astro`).
- **Content**: `src/locales/{lang}/portfolioPage.json` - All text content, project data, and categories.

## Customization

Unlike the specific landing page sections, the Portfolio Page is entirely data-driven via localization files. This makes it easy to add projects without touching the code.

### Managing Projects

Edit `src/locales/en/portfolioPage.json` to manage your projects.

```json title="src/locales/en/portfolioPage.json"
{
  "projects": {
    "p1": {
      "title": "Project Name",
      "description": "Short description for the card.",
      "longDescription": "longer description for the detail view...",
      "category": "webapp",
      "techStack": ["React", "Node.js"],
      "color": "from-violet-500 to-fuchsia-500"
    }
  }
}
```

### Categories

Categories are defined in the same JSON file and used for filtering.

```json
{
  "filterAll": "All",
  "categoryLabels": {
    "webapp": "Web App",
    "mobile": "Mobile App"
  }
}
```

## Features

- **Dynamic Filtering**: Client-side filtering by category with smooth animations.
- **Detail View**: Expandable details panel for each project showing "Challenge", "Solution", and "Impact".
- **Theme Adaptation**: Automatically uses the correct header, footer, and styling for the active theme.
- **Responsive**: Fully responsive layout that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
