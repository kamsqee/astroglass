# 404 Page

AstroGlass includes a sophisticated 404 Error page that automatically adapts to the user's selected theme.

## Architecture

Located at `src/pages/404.astro`.

The page uses CSS variables defined in `src/styles/_themes.css` to render standard 404 visuals (floating particles, glowing orbs, glass cards) that match the active color palette.

## Features

- **Theme Adaptive**: If a user is browsing with the "Luxury" theme and hits a 404, the error page will be Gold/Black. If they are on "Neo", it will be Black/Cyan.
- **Interactive Background**: Features animated elements like floating particles and morphing blobs.
- **Localization**: Fully translated messages via `src/locales/{lang}/common.json` (keys starting with `notFound`).

## Usage

This page is automatically served by Astro (and most deployment platforms like Cloudflare/Vercel) when a user requests a non-existent route. No configuration is required.
