import Callout from '../../../../../components/mdx/Callout.astro';

The Features section highlights product or service benefits. Each theme provides a unique layout — from card grids to animated lists.

## Theme Variants

| Theme | Component | Layout |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Liquid** | `FeaturesLiquid.astro` | Animated feature cards with liquid hover effects |
| **Glass** | `FeaturesGlass.astro` | Frosted glass feature cards |
| **Neo** | `FeaturesNeo.astro` | Bold grid layout with sharp edges |
| **Luxury** | `FeaturesLuxury.astro` | Elegant grid with gold highlights |
| **Minimal** | `FeaturesMinimal.astro` | Clean, simple list format |
| **Aurora** | `FeaturesAurora.astro` | Gradient mesh background with card grid |

All variants are located at `src/components/sections/features/`.

## Content Source

Feature data is loaded from `src/locales/{lang}/features.json` via `useTranslations()`. The JSON structure typically contains:

```json title="features.json (excerpt)"
{
  "title": "Why Choose Us",
  "subtitle": "Built for performance and ease of use",
  "items": [
    {
      "title": "Lightning Fast",
      "description": "Static generation for sub-second load times."
    }
  ]
}
```

<Callout type="info" title="No Props">
  Features components take no external props. To edit feature items, titles, or descriptions, update `src/locales/{lang}/features.json`.
</Callout>

## Customizing

To customize:
1. Edit the theme variant in `src/components/sections/features/Features{Theme}.astro`.
2. Adjust styles in `src/styles/components/features/`.
3. Change content in `src/locales/{lang}/features.json`.
