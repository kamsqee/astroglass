import Callout from '../../../../../components/mdx/Callout.astro';

The Pricing section displays product plans and tiers. Each theme has its own visual treatment.

## Theme Variants

| Theme | Component | Style |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Liquid** | `PricingLiquid.astro` | Fluid card layout with gradient accents |
| **Glass** | `PricingGlass.astro` | Frosted pricing cards |
| **Neo** | `PricingNeo.astro` | High-contrast pricing grid |
| **Luxury** | `PricingLuxury.astro` | Gold accent pricing with premium feel |
| **Minimal** | `PricingMinimal.astro` | Clean, simple pricing list |
| **Aurora** | `PricingAurora.astro` | Gradient background pricing cards |

All variants are located at `src/components/sections/pricing/`.

## Content Source

Pricing data is loaded from `src/locales/{lang}/pricing.json` via `useTranslations()`. The JSON contains plan names, descriptions, prices, features, and CTA text.

```json title="pricing.json (excerpt)"
{
  "title": "Simple Pricing",

  "plans": {

      "name": "Starter",
      "price": "19",
      "features": ["5 Projects", "Basic Analytics"]
    }
  }
}
```
