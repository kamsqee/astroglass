import Callout from '../../../../../components/mdx/Callout.astro';

The Contact section provides validated contact forms. Each theme has its own visual style, but they all share the same Valibot-based validation logic.

## Theme Variants

| Theme | Component | Style |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Liquid** | `ContactLiquid.astro` | Fluid form design with gradient accents |
| **Glass** | `ContactGlass.astro` | Frosted glass form card |
| **Neo** | `ContactNeo.astro` | Bold, high-contrast form |
| **Luxury** | `ContactLuxury.astro` | Premium form with gold details |
| **Minimal** | `ContactMinimal.astro` | Clean, simple contact form |
| **Aurora** | `ContactAurora.astro` | Gradient background form |

All variants are located at `src/components/sections/contact/`.

## Validation

Contact forms use **Valibot** for lightweight, type-safe validation on both client and server.

- Client-side validation provides instant UI feedback.
- The shared schema lives at `src/lib/schemas/contact.ts`.
- Validation error messages are fully translated via `src/locales/{lang}/contact.json`.

See the [Forms & Validation Guide](/docs/en/guides/forms-and-validation) for details.

## Content Source

Contact content and validation messages are loaded from `src/locales/{lang}/contact.json`.

<Callout type="info" title="No Props">
  Contact components take no external props. To edit form labels or validation messages, update `src/locales/{lang}/contact.json`.
</Callout>
