AstroGlass implements a modern take on glassmorphism — creating interfaces that feel layered, transparent, and premium.

## The Recipe

The glassmorphism effect is achieved through four key CSS properties working together:

1.  **Backdrop Blur**: We use `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` for the frosted effect.
2.  **Translucency**: Background colors use alpha channels (e.g., `bg-white/10`).
3.  **Borders**: Subtle 1px borders (`border-white/20`) define the edges.
4.  **Shadows**: Soft, colored shadows create depth and elevation.

This combination creates a sense of hierarchy and modernity.

## Practical Usage

In AstroGlass components, you'll see this pattern applied as Tailwind utility classes:

```html
<div class="backdrop-blur-xl bg-white/5 border border-white/10 rounded-2xl shadow-lg">
  Glassmorphic container
</div>
```

For dark themes, the effect is often layered with gradient backgrounds:

```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-white/5 to-white/[0.02] backdrop-blur-xl border border-white/10">
  Dark glassmorphic card
</div>
```

## Theme Variations

Each theme in AstroGlass interprets glassmorphism differently:

| Theme | Glass Style |
|-------|-------------|
| **Liquid** | Organic shapes with fluid blob backgrounds |
| **Glass** | Classic frosted panels with depth |
| **Neo** | Bold contrast with sharp edges |
| **Luxury** | Gold-tinted translucency with premium shadows |
| **Minimal** | Subtle, barely-there transparency |
| **Aurora** | Gradient mesh backgrounds with geometric structure |

<Callout type="tip" title="Customizing Glass Effects">
  The intensity of blur, opacity, and border effects can be adjusted per-theme through the CSS variables in `src/styles/_themes.css`. Look for `--glass-blur`, `--glass-opacity`, and related custom properties.
