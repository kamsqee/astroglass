Architecture Overview The theming system consists of three main layers: 1. Theme Registry: Definitions for each theme in . 2. CSS Custom Properties: Theme-aware variables defined in . 3. Dynamic Rendering: The page dynamically renders the correct component variant for each section. Theme Registry Every theme is registered in . This centralizes theme metadata and makes it available to the entire application. - src/ - config/ - themes.ts Each theme definition includes: CSS Variables Theme-specific colors and effects are controlled through CSS custom properties. Variables are scoped to a attribute on the or tag. Components consume these via or Tailwind utilities: Variables use short names (, , , , , , ) to stay consistent with the DaisyUI-inspired naming convention used throughout the project. Dynamic Component Rendering Theme pages are rendered by . This file uses a component map to dynamically select the correct variant for each section: Each section variant is a self-contained Astro component. It uses internally for all text — no external props are needed. This allows each theme to have completely different HTML structures while maintaining a uniform API. Creating a New Theme 1. Add Theme Definition Add the theme definition object to . 2. Define CSS Variables Define the new theme's CSS variables in . 3.

The Recipe The glassmorphism effect is achieved through four key CSS properties working together: 1. Backdrop Blur: We use for the frosted effect. 2. Translucency: Background colors use alpha channels (e.g., ). 3. Borders: Subtle 1px borders () define the edges. 4. Shadows: Soft, colored shadows create depth and elevation. This combination creates a sense of hierarchy and modernity. Practical Usage In AstroGlass components, you'll see this pattern applied as Tailwind utility classes: For dark themes, the effect is often layered with gradient backgrounds: Theme Variations Each theme in AstroGlass interprets glassmorphism differently: | Theme | Glass Style | |-------|-------------| | Liquid | Organic shapes with fluid blob backgrounds | | Glass | Classic frosted panels with depth | | Neo | Bold contrast with sharp edges | | Luxury | Gold-tinted translucency with premium shadows | | Minimal | Subtle, barely-there transparency | | Aurora | Gradient mesh backgrounds with geometric structure | The intensity of blur, opacity, and border effects can be adjusted per-theme through the CSS variables in .

Define specific rules (Optional) If you need custom rules beyond the shared , create a new schema in . 2. Add the Form to your Component Copy this pattern. The key is strict naming of inputs and the class handling. Theme-Aware Styles We've built a CSS system that automatically adapts validation styles to your active theme (Liquid, Glass, Minimal, etc.).
